        "“We make an annual walking ritual on the coast with a sense of worry about the heap of vulnerabilities accompanying the sinking of Jakarta. We walked through disputed land, frequent floods, contested coastline, contaminated mangrove forest, observing mutant fish due to the collapsing of ecological carrying capacity and the construction of a giant sea wall crammed with mythological fiction among the scandalous siege of artificial islands. To see what’s been happening right now makes us not so optimistic to project the future. But as artists, we believe beauty is always present anywhere even in a catastrophe.” ^^\

        "“The concepts of gender and sexual difference built on equality, according to the classical model of politics, are no longer useful for understanding contemporary social emancipation. Neither are they no longer sufficient to oppose power relations. What new subjectivities or post-socialist movements are pursuing is the destruction of gender identity, exiting the trap of both worlds (male/female) united into one (heterosexuality). To not assign or be assigned to an identity means to enable the construction and proliferation of possible worlds. Yet, processes of heterogeneous nomadic and evolving subjectivity are opening up on the horizon.” ^^\

So one of its main functions can be identified in the rewriting of complex histories, locally interwoven and situated, but never taken on by the univocality of modernity. Or, in other words, such that can restore a reserve of potential that has not been exhausted in history, never definitively completed in it.”^^\

        "  “I think ‘action’ in photography is something to do with that sense of freshness. My photographs render everything into reality: they are a way of bringing something back to life. You can talk about photographs in terms of ‘shooting’—to ‘shoot’ with a camera like you would shoot with a gun. However, for me, taking photos is not like shooting something: it’s like being shot. I am shot, and the entire timeline of my existence is resurrected in the photograph. So, I think photography is the revival of eternal time and eternal life; a photograph is not a representation of time that has been killed. In such conditions, that means that I myself am firmly embedded in the photograph.” ^^\

We are interested in extending the concept of ethnography into the microbial domain by considering the role of the biological systems as they become part of the interpretation (of events) and participate in the preservation, transformation and the remediation of materials inside the vessels.” ^^\

        " Maybe the most important thing is learning what listening is about, and breaking lots of clichés I had, and a lot of people around me had on what the act of listening is. For me now, the act of listening is multiple collaborations which became an act that involved all the senses - and that mirrors a bit what I was telling you about my interest in Marfa, coming here and feeling the wind, seeing the landscape and hearing the sounds. For me, the act of listening became this: mobilising all the senses towards understanding what is the sound we're trying to catch? And not closing the eyes and focusing on the sound while trying to channel it through the ears. For me now, this total act is tactile, is physical, is visual, is multi-sensorial in many ways.” ^^\

You have to try to give an answer, rather than limiting yourself to questioning and criticizing. In a way, through the answer you also express a critique, but in a subtler way, through action. As an activist, you can of course be manipulated, so the trap is always there. But by going more directly into a solution, you get something more real which can’t be manipulated so easily by other people’s agendas. The important thing is that it never becomes us against them. When it becomes all about defeating your enemy, you lose sight of the change you want to see in the world. That’s what I’ve learned from my experience anyway.”^^\

Are they filled with cultural and cosmic points that activate our human memory when we go for a walk there? Is a magnetic and magic property of a landscape earthy, and are the sensations of our molecular, cell-like perception similar for all living beings within the same environment? How do we see landscape, which guides our way of seeing with its cosmological properties? What scaling, what dynamics of visual representation contain what knowledge?

Bahkan mereka carikan rumput untuk makan kuda  dan dibawa ke lapangan. Saya jalan dengan dua ekor kuda milik sendiri, Merpu dan Arjuna Ireng. Kuda itu jenis sandalwood pony atau kuda pacu asli Indonesia setinggi 140 cm. Saya banyak mengobrol dengan anak-anak di jalan. Tapi begitu saya tanya soal asal usul nama kampung, mereka tidak tahu dan tidak bisa cerita. Orangtuanya juga pada tidak tahu. Saya prihatin, karena saya ingin menulis daerah-daerah yang saya lalui, tapi tidak ada yang bisa bantu karena tidak pada tahun. Kalau cerita kampung itu hilang, mereka tidak ada ikatan emosional dengan kampung itu. Sehingga akhirnya mereka bisa tidak peduli dengan kampung itu. Imbasnya bahaya, mulai dari kemiskinan sampai pengangguran karena proses urbanisasi. Sehingga begitu saya pulang, saya janji akan membawa buku ke kampung-kampung itu. Saya tidak membuat perpusatakaan. Tapi awal Pustaka Bergerak ada di Purbalingga.”  “If the stories of these villages disappear, they won't have any emotional ties to that village. Even at its end, they'll be apathetic towards the village. This harmful impact began with poverty and unemployment due to the process of urbanisation.
