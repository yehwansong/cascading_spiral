For me, the act of listening became this: mobilising all the senses towards understanding what is the sound we're trying to catch?

Bahkan mereka carikan rumput untuk makan kuda  dan dibawa ke lapangan. Saya jalan dengan dua ekor kuda milik sendiri, Merpu dan Arjuna Ireng. Kuda itu jenis sandalwood pony atau kuda pacu asli Indonesia setinggi 140 cm. Saya banyak mengobrol dengan anak-anak di jalan. Tapi begitu saya tanya soal asal usul nama kampung, mereka tidak tahu dan tidak bisa cerita. Orangtuanya juga pada tidak tahu. Saya prihatin, karena saya ingin menulis daerah-daerah yang saya lalui, tapi tidak ada yang bisa bantu karena tidak pada tahun. Kalau cerita kampung itu hilang, mereka tidak ada ikatan emosional dengan kampung itu. Sehingga akhirnya mereka bisa tidak peduli dengan kampung itu. Imbasnya bahaya, mulai dari kemiskinan sampai pengangguran karena proses urbanisasi. Sehingga begitu saya pulang, saya janji akan membawa buku ke kampung-kampung itu.

You have to try to give an answer, rather than limiting yourself to questioning and criticizing. In a way, through the answer you also express a critique, but in a subtler way, through action. As an activist, you can of course be manipulated, so the trap is always there. But by going more directly into a solution, you get something more real which can’t be manipulated so easily by other people’s agendas. The important thing is that it never becomes us against them.

At the same time, rhythm can be the substance that dissolves a community. Rhythm is very difficult to define. It is found everywhere, even where there isn’t in appearance. Some theorists suggest that there is rhythm wherever there is an expenditure of energy. In this way, rhythm can give us insight in how to be friendly and hospitable to those whom we don’t share a rhythm.”<span class=\"quote\">            CHRISTIAN NYAMPETA </span>",

            "“For me, a mobile cheese making unit is playing on those contradictions: making cheese entails changing the state of matter from liquid to solid; it is microbiological livestock management and an ancient pastoralist biotechnology. The wish to learn it fast, in one morning workshop, deals with our wish for instant gratification. The “authentic” foods we yearn for could also be accessible, self-made, and not elite gastronomic merchandise. It’s a way to reconnect with food makers and the problems they face. Food is therefore more than a political tool, it has become politics in itself.”<span class=\"quote\">         arthere website announcing the footsteps library when it is published          FERNANDO GARCÍA-DORY</span>",

I implement an “open art system,” in which art is defined as broadly as possible, to break through rigid discourses and established values, engaging in democratic dialogue, but also taking a critical approach when needed. During this process, outcomes—artworks or other forms—are produced collectively, collaboratively or individually. Another aim is to create and maintain a network that enables the exchange of ideas and experiences, or development in the form of collaborations.”<span class=\"quote\">         ARAHMAIANI FEISAL </span>",
