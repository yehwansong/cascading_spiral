QUOTES
“I feel that I can easily cross cultural borders. I think that is what is wonderful about not having a fixed notion of identity or nationhood. There is really nothing I have a duty to do. It bothers people, this refusal to choose between us and them because I guess when you announce your identity publicly people know what to expect. If I were to identify with anything, it would be Afghanistan because it's a country that needs so much attention.”
[From interview on http://www.artvehicle.com/interview/1 ]
“I wanted to turn the ruins into sculptures because they carry for me the memory of something lost, yet at the same time they are reminders of what is no longer there. A fragment. Yet complete in its own way because any attempt to fix it, will erase its uniqueness. It teaches nothing, except that what was once is gone and the only way to approach it is through art without direct reference to an event.”
[From interview on http://www.artvehicle.com/interview/1 ]
“Whatever transformation art has the potential to bring about cannot be immediately seen. It's an invisible process simultaneously cathartic and active. I feel that only if people engaged with one another through their art, culture and music and genuinely resist trying to reduce the 'other' to what is familiar to themselves, a lot of change can come about.”

QUOTES
“We have to act with dignity. We promise not to offer any solutions whatsoever. (All we can do is perhaps offer a couple of temporary remedies for the reigning “uncuriosity syndrome” around the globe.) We do not want to give you anything; we want to take as much as possible from you. For, we are in this project together –- A project which represents the values we all share.”
[From Açık Radyo’s Manifesto, 1995
https://acikradyo.com.tr/manifesto-acik-radyo ]

“The “Serial of the Universe”, the never ending history of our wars, the terrifying hum of the earthquake, our warming air and water, our globalisation, our greeds, our angers, our rights, our economies and our crises, our road maps showing the way to European civilisation, our terror maps reaching into the depths of black holes, our genome maps, our diseases, our miraculous remedies, as well as the birds and the bees, the one-for-the-roads, the poor, the women, the children, the child abusers, the splendour and the misery of the media, the music of the spheres, and, last but not least: “All the beauty of human civilization – our art, our music, our literature – lies beyond these two fundamentalist, ideological poles.” (Roy) Our Open Site is a small flashlight, but one whose handle stretches to fit as many hands as want to hold it or hold on to it.”

NIRWAN AHMAD ARSUKA, PUSTAKA BERGERAK
QUOTES
“Kini, kembali seluruh relawan diundang untuk jadi seniman. Yang mengundang kali ini adalah penyelenggara Istanbul Bienal, Turki. Karya relawan yang memikat bukan hanya akan dapat dinikmati oleh warga Indonesia, atau Turki saja, tapi oleh seluruh dunia.”
“The Istanbul Biennial is an opportunity for our volunteers to become artists. The creations of our volunteers would therefore not only be enjoyed by the citizens of Indonesia, or Turkey, but by the whole world. “
[From his Facebook https://www.facebook.com/pg/pustakabergerak.id/posts/ (27 Jan) ]
“Kedua, waktu tahun 2014 saya berkuda dari Pamulang, Tangerang Selatan ke Parompong, Bandung, lewat jalan kampung. Saya banyak dibantu anak-anak untuk menunjukkan jalan. Bahkan mereka carikan rumput untuk makan kuda  dan dibawa ke lapangan. Saya jalan dengan dua ekor kuda milik sendiri, Merpu dan Arjuna Ireng. Kuda itu jenis sandalwood pony atau kuda pacu asli Indonesia setinggi 140 cm. Saya banyak mengobrol dengan anak-anak di jalan. Tapi begitu saya tanya soal asal usul nama kampung, mereka tidak tahu dan tidak bisa cerita. Orangtuanya juga pada tidak tahu. Saya prihatin, karena saya ingin menulis daerah-daerah yang saya lalui, tapi tidak ada yang bisa bantu karena tidak pada tahun. Kalau cerita kampung itu hilang, mereka tidak ada ikatan emosional dengan kampung itu. Sehingga akhirnya mereka bisa tidak peduli dengan kampung itu. Imbasnya bahaya, mulai dari kemiskinan sampai pengangguran karena proses urbanisasi. Sehingga begitu saya pulang, saya janji akan membawa buku ke kampung-kampung itu. Saya tidak membuat perpusatakaan. Tapi awal Pustaka Bergerak ada di Purbalingga.” 
 
“If the stories of these villages disappear, they won't have any emotional ties to that village. Even at its end, they'll be apathetic towards the village. This harmful impact began with poverty and unemployment due to the process of urbanisation. When I returned, I promised I would bring books to the village.”

“Selain itu, sejak awal saya ingin memberikan karakter lokal dengan gerakan Pustaka Bergerak. Karena Pustaka Bergerak ini bukan hanya gerakan literasi, tapi kultural yang menonjolkan aspirasi para relawannya. Kami ingin masyarakat bangga dengan budaya lokalnya.”
“This isn't just a literacy movement, but a cultural one that takes aspirations from its volunteers. We want the citizens to be proud of their local identity.”

ATELIER D’ARCHITECTURE AUTOGEREE 
QUOTES
“It is by micro-political acting that we want to participate in making the city more ecological and more democratic, to make the space of proximity less dependent on top-down processes and more accessible to its users. The ‘self-managed architecture’ is an architecture of relationships, processes and agencies of persons, desires, skills and know-hows. Such an architecture does not correspond to a liberal practice but asks for new forms of association and collaboration, based on exchange and reciprocity and involving all those interested (individuals, organisations, institutions), whatever is their scale.”
[from their website https://www.urbantactics.org/about/ ]
“Our architecture is at the same time political and poetic as it aims above all to ‘create relationships between worlds’.”

“Significant to Atienza’s aesthetic practice is her active social obligation to her community. Rather than passively documenting the people and ecology of Bantayan Island, her social practice helps to augment the full complexities of human subjectivity, society and the environment.

TAREK ATOUI, I/E ISTANBUL 
QUOTES
 “I/E is a collective instrument that responds to outdoor situations. On this project, I wanted to propose new ways of working with concrete sound and field recording. For me, working in, out and from exterior environments has become important. The environment is not just sound material or a sound source – its acoustics and social dynamics, for example, can inform composition and inspire new ways to perform and collaborate.”
[From his interview with Stephanie Bailey, 8/5/2014
 https://www.ibraaz.org/interviews/130 ]
“My work as a composer is to let [dissonance, resonance, and harmony] be by giving them the parameters to co-exist. For me, my role as a composer starts with setting up the constraints of the encounters and the collaborations that my pieces generate. These constraints are the space, the relation to the audience, the relation between the performers – this was the case with I/E.”
[From his interview with Stephanie Bailey, 8/5/2014
 https://www.ibraaz.org/interviews/130 ]
 “Working with deaf people totally changed my practice. [...] Maybe the most important thing is learning what listening is about, and breaking lots of clichés I had, and a lot of people around me had on what the act of listening is. For me now, the act of listening is multiple collaborations which became an act that involved all the senses - and that mirrors a bit what I was telling you about my interest in Marfa, coming here and feeling the wind, seeing the landscape and hearing the sounds. For me, the act of listening became this: mobilising all the senses towards understanding what is the sound we're trying to catch? And not closing the eyes and focusing on the sound while trying to channel it through the ears. For me now, this total act is tactile, is physical, is visual, is multi-sensorial in many ways.”

URSULA BIEMANN, DEVENIR UNIVERSITY
QUOTES 
"The indigenous scientist is the ultimate radical figure which has the capacity of merging the contradictions; of being at once scientific and a political actor, cohabiting the natural world while seeking to understand it. Most importantly, this figure stands for a different kind of epistemology that reconnects us to other ways of knowing the human-nature symbiosis. In other words, this figure embodies some of the most fundamental problems in our mind-nature conception."

"One of the core ideas of the university as a decolonial exercise is to foreground how important it is for education to encounter the Other as mind. What indigenous knowledge intends to teach, and the Inga, in particular, is that the Other is mind. The Other is person. That we co-emerge in the relationship with the Other."

“ We were really interested in how we could use it as a tool to think about emancipating or decolonizing contemporary food practices.

“We need to increase the number of readers of Indonesian literature, and to make this possible the price of books must come down. For example, this slim volume of Indonesian fiction I’m holding costs Rp4,500. A kilogram of rice costs Rp500, so you could buy 9 kilos of rice for the price of this one book.”

QUOTES
“...in the sense of claiming a degrading discourse: claiming the "crank" (the ill, the feigning ill, the one who begs and the collapse of the distinction between the three). Opacity and the right to not be understood.”
[From Crip Magazine Issue No. 1 by Eva Egermann (14-15/24) https://issuu.com/cripmagazine/docs/crip_magazine_1 ]
 
“...I have often wondered how the intensity of politicization, collectivity, debates, and counter publics in various projects can be harnessed to create something sustainable in the long term that would in turn effect more concrete changes. But these changes are taking place; for what we do does something to us.”

ARAHMAIANI FEISAL 
QUOTES
“The “Flag Project” is designed to study and develop collective creativity. I implement an “open art system,” in which art is defined as broadly as possible, to break through rigid discourses and established values, engaging in democratic dialogue, but also taking a critical approach when needed. During this process, outcomes—artworks or other forms—are produced collectively, collaboratively or individually. Another aim is to create and maintain a network that enables the exchange of ideas and experiences, or development in the form of collaborations.”

“But ultimately, who is it going to answer? Not the authority. In fact, that almost never happened. I realized the most realistic thing was to answer to the problem myself. You have to try to give an answer, rather than limiting yourself to questioning and criticizing. In a way, through the answer you also express a critique, but in a subtler way, through action. As an activist, you can of course be manipulated, so the trap is always there. But by going more directly into a solution, you get something more real which can’t be manipulated so easily by other people’s agendas. The important thing is that it never becomes us against them. When it becomes all about defeating your enemy, you lose sight of the change you want to see in the world. That’s what I’ve learned from my experience anyway.”

“Footsteps is a learning process, an attempt to collect stories from the margins of wars. Stories that are urgent but for which the pathways for the conversations that lead to these stories are uncertain and difficult. Sometimes a few words, a short story, a memory or a dream could describe the experience of living with war in an explicit way.”

“The Footsteps Library is calling!
Footsteps Library, located in arthereistanbul in Kadıköy, has set out to establish reading groups in three languages; Turkish, English and Arabic. The library focuses on experiences and stories that are overshadowed, left in the dark and fog by wars. The reading group is a step towards discovering overlooked, invisible, and nebulous war stories.”

FERNANDO GARCÍA-DORY
QUOTES
“For me, a mobile cheese making unit is playing on those contradictions: making cheese entails changing the state of matter from liquid to solid; it is microbiological livestock management and an ancient pastoralist biotechnology. The wish to learn it fast, in one morning workshop, deals with our wish for instant gratification. The “authentic” foods we yearn for could also be accessible, self-made, and not elite gastronomic merchandise. It’s a way to reconnect with food makers and the problems they face. Food is therefore more than a political tool, it has become politics in itself.”
[From his interview titled BENEATH THE BUREAUCRACY, THE BEACH by Chris Fite-Wassilak https://www.fernandogarciadory.info/index.php?/texts/interview-artpapers-janfeb-2011/2/ ] 
“The artist has to cook, prepare the table, and do the dishes for a determined social subject to partake in the meal—a humble position that doesn’t conform to the idea of the unique, genius artist. By pushing the managerial dimension to the limit, I seek to define the limitation of that form of art. I confront myself with that exhausting task as the opposite of creative process.”
[From his interview titled BENEATH THE BUREAUCRACY, THE BEACH by Chris Fite-Wassilak https://www.fernandogarciadory.info/index.php?/texts/interview-artpapers-janfeb-2011/2/ ] 
“In the art context, my practice is more about just diverting attention to certain questions and topics I find interesting, like food systems or rural environment. But with my projects, like what I’m doing with this village, it’s more about creating a space for other forms of life—a collective life with a land-based economy, a community of practice that’s beyond the discursive aspect of activism.”
[From his interview with Sarah J. Halford, Emily Bellor, 12/1/2019
https://c4aa.org/2019/01/fernando-garcia-dory ]
“The growth and relocalisation involves also forms of food autonomy - and this is very important. The restoration of these life support systems, which we need to look at, involves also cultivation [...] a concept that is connected with care, and connected also with [..] a new humanist paradigm that we could say is also post-human as it no longer puts human beings at the centre of creation [...] but to consider ourselves as part of a cycle together with other living forms.”

“My attitude towards my artistic production was always to involve references and connotations from my lived environment and my internal thoughts, and so comes from myself, my true organism and my life in Istanbul. As I was unable to leave Turkey for 16 years because I was not permitted a passport, I became intent on observing everything that was going on around me. The opportunity to travel opened up another horizon that allowed international discourse on post-colonialism and paradigm shifts, but the subjects and interests I worked with continued to be those that were within my daily reach.”

“What can we learn from this kind of seeing of different landscapes? Are the traces we are pursuing to be found outside or inside this sensory system?

"His ‘European eyes’ saw in Japanese architecture the concrete materialisation of aesthetic values—minimalism, pure geometry, simplicity of forms—that were shared by many modern architects in the Old Continent and that were allegedly exemplified by artefacts such as the ancient complex of Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. Taut’s Japanese admirers [...] found in his work a solid confirmation of their quest for modernisation, an aspect that made plain the anxieties generated by their country’s rapid social and economic transformation."
[From research paper “West of Japan/East of Europe: Translating Architectural Legacies and the Case of Bruno Taut’s Hyuga Villa” by Paolo Scrivano and Marco Capitanio
https://built-heritage.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/BF03545693.pdf ]
 
“Taut's culture/nature pair as a key concept to re-find the local roots of a community, the concept of continuity, his re-fashioned interest in regional architectural qualities, and above all the notion of a synthesis of tradition and modernity, all seem to echo the same dialectical opposition mediating inside a nationalistic ideology fostered by the Ministry of Education in those years, based on the historical interplay between a spontaneous support of modernist and progressive trends and a radical quest for cultural identity that distinguished the emerging nationalist politics in Turkey.”
 
[From research paper “Bruno Taut and the Program for the Protection of Monuments in Turkey (1937-38): Three Case Studies: Ankara, Edirne and Bursa” Giorgio Gasco, Bilkent University

“Taut in fact often stated that "national character" should not be pursued as a main goal in design, clear evidence that he himself was not in search for a national style (although others were). Nevertheless, his discourse lent itself to be easily assimilated into the stream of state rhetoric.”

NEPAL FEMINIST MEMORY by the NEPAL PICTURE LIBRARY 
QUOTES
“The idea of claiming place in public life was one of the most significant themes that emerged from the materials we collected. The distinctions between the private and the public have a complex history in Nepal, as elsewhere, but these concepts are also repeatedly mobilised by women in the narratives about their own lives—describing their moves from one sphere to the other as a major transition or a breaking of barriers that held them back.”
[ From curatorial statement “The public life of women” by Diwas Kc, 13/10/2018
https://kathmandupost.com/miscellaneous/2018/10/13/the-public-life-of-women]
 
“A history of women, in our opinion, is first and foremost a social history. We have curated this exhibition as a call to contribute to the archive we have started building. We seek and welcome more materials that will help us achieve this mission of a more inclusive history—and future—of Nepal.”

CHRISTIAN NYAMPETA 
QUOTES
“We tend to form some kind of a community with those we share a rhythm. Such rhythm can be a construct, but once it is constructed, rhythm becomes a regulator, a substance that binds. At the same time, rhythm can be the substance that dissolves a community. Rhythm is very difficult to define. It is found everywhere, even where there isn’t in appearance. Some theorists suggest that there is rhythm wherever there is an expenditure of energy. In this way, rhythm can give us insight in how to be friendly and hospitable to those whom we don’t share a rhythm.”

“This is actually a Rwandan proverb. [...] Proverbs are not maxims, aphorisms, axioms, or adages that could constitute some kind of Rwandan Holy Book of good observance. For the scholarship I learn from, they simply mark the limits of the knowable. And, to me, these limits can be diagrammed in terms of modes of existence marked by a rhythm of giving-receiving-giving.”

“[...] this radiophonic format is a time zone that fuses generations of changes endured across trans-familial lines spread over immeasurable geographic expanses into a new common world, while, at the same time, avoiding forceful amalgamation. [...] I myself remember lots of radio moments! One of them indeed occurred during the height of the misery in Rwanda, when I chose to listen to BBC World Service on short waves. It offered this super distant and otherworldly voice that somehow made life bearable by keeping me from being pulled into the depths of despair, lassitude and euphoria. Radio has this way of connecting isolations; it allows cultural works to travel and circulate.”

"These other ways of thinking about the community, or the society tended to bypass - or to go behind, in time - the dominant discourse. In a way, to me, it offered a certain kind of mobility - and mobility is of course, not freedom as such - but the mobility to move across time, and to look at other ways of thinking; the communal, or the common. [...] It has that dimension of - I don't want to use a difficult word, but - paleonymic [Derrida]; something old, like an old name, which then enables (us) to move ahead."

AHMET ÖĞÜT, SILENT UNIVERSITY 
QUOTES
“The Silent University is a solidarity based knowledge exchange platform by displaced people and forced migrants. It is led by a group of lecturers, consultants and research fellows. It is an education platform outside of the restrictions of migration laws, language limitations and the other bureaucratic obstacles.”
[From the Silent University website
http://thesilentuniversity.org/ ] 
 
“The Silent University aims to address and reactivate the knowledge of the participants and make the exchange process mutually beneficial by inventing alternative currencies, in place of money or free voluntary service. The Silent University’s aim is to challenge the idea of silence as a passive state, and explore its powerful potential through performance, writing, and group reflection. These explorations attempt to make apparent the systemic failure and the loss of skills and knowledge experienced through the silencing process of people seeking asylum.”

PATHSHALA SOUTH ASIAN MEDIA INSTITUTE, SYNTHESIS 
QUOTES
“In south Asia, many people still believe in images as evidence. Our revolutionary movements, such as the war of independence in 1971, evolved through the narratives told by images. They give us a vision. As Shahidul Alam always says, fear is contagious but courage is contagious too. Photographs can help bring back our courage and show us ways to envisage a better future.”

“The photographers in the West were photographing someone else’s struggle. I was an activist taking photographs of my own movement. The political stories I was trying to tell are much more complex than the tightly packaged stories of Western photographers. Class issues, issues of religion, environmental issues, are all part of it.”

“Watching Shahidul work, often times from a distance and sometimes when lucky, from close proximity, I have come to learn that institution building is not about the edifices we construct and the hardware we amass. Institution building is a slow process of nurturing people, our capacity to be more effective professionals, but also and perhaps more importantly, nurturing our spirit and convictions.”

“Giving responsibilities away is a platform to share “possibilities.” I compose these possibilities and apply them to contemporary art spaces. I’m interested in what lies between them.

QUOTES
“We make an annual walking ritual on the coast with a sense of worry about the heap of vulnerabilities accompanying the sinking of Jakarta. We walked through disputed land, frequent floods, contested coastline, contaminated mangrove forest, observing mutant fish due to the collapsing of ecological carrying capacity and the construction of a giant sea wall crammed with mythological fiction among the scandalous siege of artificial islands. To see what’s been happening right now makes us not so optimistic to project the future. But as artists, we believe beauty is always present anywhere even in a catastrophe.”

MARCO SCOTINI, THE DISOBEDIENCE ARCHIVE 
QUOTES
“The concepts of gender and sexual difference built on equality, according to the classical model of politics, are no longer useful for understanding contemporary social emancipation. Neither are they no longer sufficient to oppose power relations. What new subjectivities or post-socialist movements are pursuing is the destruction of gender identity, exiting the trap of both worlds (male/female) united into one (heterosexuality). To not assign or be assigned to an identity means to enable the construction and proliferation of possible worlds. Yet, processes of heterogeneous nomadic and evolving subjectivity are opening up on the horizon.”
 
[from his project’s website http://www.disobediencearchive.org/ ] 
 
 
“Two curatorial models have been significant for my work, and both converge in a deconstruction of the narratives of Western modernity. One is linked to Disobedience Archive (2005-2014), in which the exhibition was conceived following an archive format and as a criticism of policies that are incapable of integrating forms of life within them. (…) There is another, more recent model that I would call “the geopolitical sphere and Western modernity,” ” 
 
[from his interview in Mousse Magazine / 01.06.2020
 https://www.moussemagazine.it/magazine/geopolitical-curating-marco-scotini-carol-yinghua-lu-2020/]
 

“The aim of the presentation of a series of counter-exhibitions is to bring back to light the collective memories of rebellious archives, of disobedient bodies, of repressed social roles, of banned books, of removed exhibitions. So one of its main functions can be identified in the rewriting of complex histories, locally interwoven and situated, but never taken on by the univocality of modernity. Or, in other words, such that can restore a reserve of potential that has not been exhausted in history, never definitively completed in it.”

“I think ‘action’ in photography is something to do with that sense of freshness. My photographs render everything into reality: they are a way of bringing something back to life. You can talk about photographs in terms of ‘shooting’—to ‘shoot’ with a camera like you would shoot with a gun. However, for me, taking photos is not like shooting something: it’s like being shot. I am shot, and the entire timeline of my existence is resurrected in the photograph. So, I think photography is the revival of eternal time and eternal life; a photograph is not a representation of time that has been killed. In such conditions, that means that I myself am firmly embedded in the photograph.”

“I'm interested in the emphasis on experiential knowledge by mediaeval women mystic writers, which came out of their exclusion from official institutions of learning.
