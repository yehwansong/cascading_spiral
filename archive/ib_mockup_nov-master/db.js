Bahkan mereka carikan rumput untuk makan kuda  dan dibawa ke lapangan. Saya jalan dengan dua ekor kuda milik sendiri, Merpu dan Arjuna Ireng. Kuda itu jenis sandalwood pony atau kuda pacu asli Indonesia setinggi 140 cm. Saya banyak mengobrol dengan anak-anak di jalan. Tapi begitu saya tanya soal asal usul nama kampung, mereka tidak tahu dan tidak bisa cerita. Orangtuanya juga pada tidak tahu. Saya prihatin, karena saya ingin menulis daerah-daerah yang saya lalui, tapi tidak ada yang bisa bantu karena tidak pada tahun. Kalau cerita kampung itu hilang, mereka tidak ada ikatan emosional dengan kampung itu. Sehingga akhirnya mereka bisa tidak peduli dengan kampung itu. Imbasnya bahaya, mulai dari kemiskinan sampai pengangguran karena proses urbanisasi. Sehingga begitu saya pulang, saya janji akan membawa buku ke kampung-kampung itu.

You have to try to give an answer, rather than limiting yourself to questioning and criticizing. In a way, through the answer you also express a critique, but in a subtler way, through action. As an activist, you can of course be manipulated, so the trap is always there. But by going more directly into a solution, you get something more real which can’t be manipulated so easily by other people’s agendas. The important thing is that it never becomes us against them.

            "“We tend to form some kind of a community with those we share a rhythm. Such rhythm can be a construct, but once it is constructed, rhythm becomes a regulator, a substance that binds. At the same time, rhythm can be the substance that dissolves a community. Rhythm is very difficult to define. It is found everywhere, even where there isn’t in appearance. Some theorists suggest that there is rhythm wherever there is an expenditure of energy. In this way, rhythm can give us insight in how to be friendly and hospitable to those whom we don’t share a rhythm.”<span class=\"quote\">    CHRISTIAN NYAMPETA </span>",
